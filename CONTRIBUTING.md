# Contributing (solo project rules)

- Branching: create `feature/*`, `fix/*`, or `chore/*` branches from `main`.
- Commit messages: use Conventional Commits (e.g. `feat(tasks): add TasksBloc`).
- PRs: Even solo, open a PR from your feature branch to `main` and run CI before merging.
- Tests: add unit tests for repos and blocs. CI will run `flutter test`.
